# NYSE Cloud Streaming sample consumer

This project helps customers to start consuming NYSE Cloud Streaming maket data in AWS.

## NYSE Cloud Streaming

[NYSE Cloud Streaming](https://www.nyse.com/data-products), is a data distribution platform that enables customers to access and consume real-time streaming exchange data quickly, in a developer-friendly format. With NYSE Cloud Streaming, customers gain access to market data with sub-hundreds of milliseconds latency in the cloud. They can also spin up an environment in AWS within minutes without the upfront cost and logistical hurdles of building out a physical infrastructure footprint. Besides easing challenges related to infrastructure, data is published via NYSE Cloud Streaming in a Kafka-compatible stream, allowing developers to integrate data more easily in a widely used format.

## NYSE Cloud Streaming Sample APP

This project will build the necessary infra structure using [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and deploy a sample python script on an EC2 instance to consume the market data.
